@par Hardware and Software environment

- This Demo runs with IAR EWARM from version 6.20 and onwards.

  - Software environemnt
  ----------------------
     - EWARM 6.20 should be installed to support the embedded STLINK/V2.
     - STM323L-Discovery Demonstration runs using IAR EWARM 32K Kickstart Edition version 6.20
     versions available on www.iar.com

  - ST-LINK/V2 driver requirement
  ------------------------------
    - After installing EWARM 6.20, you should install the ST-LINK/V2 driver by 
      running the ST-Link_V2_USB.exe from
      [IAR_INSTALL_DIRECTORY]\Embedded Workbench 6.0_2\arm\drivers\ST-Link
      \ST-Link_V2_USBdriver.exe
        
  - Hardware environemnt
  ----------------------
     - Check jumper position on the board, JP1 on, CN3 on (Discovery selected).
     - Connect the STM32L-Discovery board to a PC with a USB cable to power the board.

@par Example Description 

This software demonstration aims to use various peripherals and connectors on
STM32L-Discovery  board.

When powering on the STM32L-Discovery board, the Red LED LD2 (PWR) then lights up.
Function 1 (see table below) is executed, and each click on user button B1 changes 
the executed function.
